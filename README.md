SSL Web scripts is a suite of scripts for generation X.509 keys/certificates for Web Applications.

Overview
--------
    
    SSL Web scripts generates X.509 keys/certificates, using as RSA as ECDSA.

    The main features of SSL Web scripts:
    
        - generation of CA ECDSA key and Self-Signed CA ECDSA Certificate;
        - generation of SSL ECDSA private key, ECDSA public key and sign ECDSA public key, using ECDSA CA key 
            and generation of X.509 certificate of server (server certificate);
        - generation of CA RSA key and Self-Signed CA RSA Certificate;
        - generation of SSL RSA private key, RSA public key and sign RSA public key, using RSA CA key 
            and generation of X.509 certificate of server (server certificate);
        - usage (by default) of Elliptic Curves (ECDSA-WITH-SHA256) prime256v1 (NIST P-256, secp256r1) or RSA
            (RSA2048-WITH-SHA256) for signing of public keys;

Usage
--------

    Suite of scripts generates/uses follow files (extensions):
        .key        - private key (ECDSA or RSA) in PEM format;
        .pub        - non-signed public key (ECDSA or RSA) in PEM format;
        .csr        - certificate request (for signing) of public key;
        .cert       - signed public key (ECDSA or RSA) (certificate) with additional text info in PEM format;
        .pem        - signed public key (ECDSA or RSA) (certificate) in PEM format;
        .chain.pem  - file, that contains list of authorized certificate(s), including root CA; 
        .p12        - archive (in PKCS12 format), that contains private key, public key (certificate), and authorized certificate(s);

    Suite of scripts contains follow directories:

                        1.  call:
                                ssl.ecdsa.sign/02.ca.sh
                                    or

                        2.  call:
                                ssl.ecdsa.req/02.srv.req.sh
                                    or

                                ssl.ecdsa.req/out/srv.sl.csr
                                    or 
                                ssl.rsa.req/out/srv.sl.csr
                        4.  call:
                                ssl.ecdsa.sign/03.srv.sign.sh
                                    or
                                ssl.rsa.sign/03.srv.sign.sh
                        5.  copy:
                                    ssl.ecdsa.sign/out/srv.sl.cert
                                        or
                                    ssl.rsa.sign/out/srv.sl.cert
                                and
                                    ssl.ecdsa.sign/out/ca.sl.cert
                                        or
                                    ssl.rsa.sign/out/ca.sl.cert 
                                to
                                    ssl.ecdsa.req/out
                                        or
                                    ssl.rsa.req/out
                        6.  call:
                                ssl.ecdsa.req/03.srv.imp.sh
                                    or
                                ssl.rsa.req/03.srv.imp.sh
                                
        You can use result files:
            ca.sl.cert/ca.sl.pem 
            srv.sl.cert/srv.sl.pem
            srv.sl.key
                or
            srv.sl.p12
        in Web Applications/Servers.
        
        Files openssl.xxx.srv.cnf contain section:
            [alt_names]
            DNS.1=localhost
        You can change domain name to some other or add some new domain name(s).
        
        In practice, you should generate Server key pair, generate Certificate request, sign Server certificate request,
            using official Authorized Centers and then import results to srv.sl.p12.
